\section{Project Description}

The project aims to develop an open-source sandbox environment for graphics payloads.

\section{Motivation Behind the Project}

Project Boxxy aims to provide affordable and accessible GPU resources to developers and researchers on resource-intensive tasks. High-end GPUs are expensive and out of reach for individuals and organizations. The project aims to address that challenge by offering a sandbox environment for developing and deploying graphics payloads.
