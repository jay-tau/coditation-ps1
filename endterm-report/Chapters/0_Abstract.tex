This project report presents the progress and outcomes of Project Boxxy, that I was a part of, during my Practice School-I (BITS F221) program.
Project Boxxy aims to develop an open-source sandbox environment tailored for graphics payloads.
The project includes a WebRTC component for delivering graphics streams on the web, a native WebGPU component for real-time graphics rendering on the server, DevSync for real-time code editing, and a remote caching system for compiled resources.
The primary objective is to provide affordable and accessible GPU resources to developers and researchers working on resource-intensive tasks. By offering a sandbox environment specifically designed for graphics development and deployment, Project Boxxy addresses the challenge of expensive and inaccessible high-end GPUs.
Through an open-source approach, it fosters collaboration and innovation while democratizing GPU resources. The project seeks to empower developers and researchers with an affordable and efficient platform for developing and deploying graphics-intensive applications.
