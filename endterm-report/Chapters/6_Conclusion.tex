Project Boxxy is an open-source solution that develops a sandbox environment for GPU-based development and deployment. Its goal is to provide accessible and affordable resources that address the challenges related to high-end GPU costs and limited collaborative development experiences. We could illustrate the project's functional, non-functional, and general requirements through diverse layouts and imagery.

I learned a lot about graphics programming and how systems are used in the industry. My PS1 at Coditation Systems proved to be a very enriching experience, with many learnings for me.
I am glad that I could work on a project I was passionate about.
