Project Boxxy is an open-source solution that develops a sandbox environment for GPU-based development and deployment. Its goal is to provide accessible and affordable resources that address the challenges related to high-end GPU costs and limited collaborative development experiences. Through diverse layouts and imagery, we could illustrate the project's functional, non-functional, and general requirements.
